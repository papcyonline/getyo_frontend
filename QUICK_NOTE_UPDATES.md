# ✅ Quick Note Screen Updates Complete!

## What's New?

Your Quick Note screen now has **pause/resume functionality** and **background recording** with push notifications!

## 🎯 Feature 1: Pause & Resume Recording

### What Changed?

Previously, you could only start and stop recordings. Now you have full control:

**Recording States:**
- **Idle** → Not recording
- **Recording** → Actively recording 🔴
- **Paused** → Recording paused ⏸️
- **Recorded** → Finished and ready to view

### How It Works

**While Recording:**
1. Tap **"Pause"** button (gold color)
   - Recording pauses
   - Timer stops
   - Status shows "Paused"

**While Paused:**
1. Tap **"Resume"** button (green color)
   - Recording continues
   - Timer resumes
   - Status shows "Recording..."

**At Any Time:**
- Tap **"Stop"** button (red color)
  - Ends recording session
  - Starts transcription
  - Saves to history

### UI Changes

**Recording Screen:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│     0:45                │ ← Timer
│   Recording...          │ ← Status (red)
│                         │
│  [Pause]  [Stop]        │ ← Buttons
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**Paused Screen:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│     0:45                │ ← Timer (frozen)
│   Paused                │ ← Status (gold)
│                         │
│  [Resume]  [Stop]       │ ← Buttons
└─────────────────────────┘
```

## 🔔 Feature 2: Background Recording

### What Changed?

Previously, leaving the app might interrupt your recording. Now:

✅ **Recording continues in background**
✅ **Push notification shows recording status**
✅ **Return to app anytime without losing recording**

### How It Works

**When You Leave the App:**

1. **If recording active:**
   - Notification appears: "🎤 Recording in Progress"
   - Shows: "Still recording... (2:30)"
   - Recording continues seamlessly

2. **If recording paused:**
   - Notification appears: "🎤 Recording in Progress"
   - Shows: "Recording paused at 2:30"
   - Stays paused until you return

**When You Return to App:**
- Notification automatically dismisses
- Recording status preserved
- Continue recording or stop as needed

**When You Stop Recording:**
- Notification immediately cleared
- Transcription starts
- Normal flow continues

### Technical Details

**Background Audio Mode Enabled:**
- iOS: `staysActiveInBackground: true`
- Android: `shouldDuckAndroid: true`
- Works in silent mode
- Doesn't interrupt music/calls (auto-ducks)

**Notification Behavior:**
- **Priority:** High (persistent)
- **Sticky:** Yes (doesn't auto-dismiss)
- **Sound:** None (silent notification)
- **Auto-dismiss:** When app returns to foreground
