## 🎨 **How to Get Memoji-Style Characters**

### **Option 1: Ready Player Me (BEST for Real Memoji-style)**

**What it is:** Create custom 3D avatars like Apple Memoji with full animations

**Steps:**

1. **Create Your Avatar:**
   - Go to [readyplayer.me](https://readyplayer.me)
   - Click "Create Avatar"
   - Customize: face, hair, clothes, accessories
   - Click "Done" and copy the URL

2. **Get Avatar URL:**
   ```
   https://models.readyplayer.me/[YOUR-ID].glb
   ```

3. **Convert to Lottie/Video:**
   - Ready Player Me avatars are 3D models (.glb files)
   - You'll need to use their React Native SDK or convert to video/Lottie

4. **Install Ready Player Me SDK:**
   ```bash
   npm install @readyplayer.me/react-native-avatar-sdk
   ```

5. **Use in your app:**
   ```tsx
   import AvatarView from '@readyplayer.me/react-native-avatar-sdk';

   <AvatarView
     avatarUrl="https://models.readyplayer.me/YOUR-ID.glb"
     style={{ width: 280, height: 320 }}
   />
   ```

// In the greeting useEffect (line 154):
useEffect(() => {
  const greetingTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    setRobotTalking();

    // Add voice greeting
    const greeting = `Hey! I'm ${user?.assistantName || 'Yo!'}`;
    Speech.speak(greeting, {
      language: 'en-US',
      pitch: 1.0,
      rate: 0.9,
      voice: 'com.apple.ttsbundle.Samantha-compact', // iOS
    });

    setTimeout(() => {
      setRobotIdle();
    }, 3000);
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearTimeout(greetingTimeout);
}, []);
```

## 📐 **Character Sizing**

4. Look for **multiple states** (idle, talking, listening)

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

**Character not showing:**
- Check Lottie URL is accessible
- Try opening URL in browser
- Clear Metro cache: `npx expo start -c`

**Character too small/big:**
- Adjust `characterContainer` width/height in styles
- Character should be 280-400px for good visibility

**Animation not smooth:**
- Use simpler animations (smaller file size)
- Check FPS (30-60 is ideal)
- Reduce animation complexity

**Want different greeting:**
- Edit line 159 in HomeScreen.tsx:
```tsx
console.log(`🗣️ Your custom greeting here!`);
```

## 📱 **Current Setup**

- **Size:** 280x320px (full body)
- **Shape:** Rectangular (not circular)
- **Greeting:** Automatic on app load
